*** YMODEM Protocol ***

The YMODEM Batch protocol is an extension to the XMODEM/1K protocol that
allows 0 or more files to be transmitted in a single session. YMODEM always
sends an information packet (number 0) with each file containing the filename
and the file length.

The filename is sent as a null terminated ASCII string. This is the filename
format used by the handle oriented MSDOS file services.

The length field is sent as a decimal ascii string counting the number of data
bytes in the file. The file length does not include the ^Z or other characters
used to pad the last block. All unused bytes in packet 0 must be set to 0.

After the filename has been transmitted, the receiver asks for file data by
sending a 'C' (or NAK for 1 byte checksum packets). The sender responds by
transmitting data packets exactly like XMODEM/1K.

After the file has been transmitted, the receiver asks for the next file by
sending a 'C' (or NAK). Transmission of a null pathname terminates the YMODEM
protocol. An EOT is not transmitted after a null pathname.

Here is an example of YMODEM:

   SENDER                       RECEIVER
   ======                       ========
                                   C
                                   C
   SOH 00 FF Filename NULs CRC CRC
                                   ACK
                                   C
   STX 01 FD Data[1024] CRC1 CRC2
                                   ACK
   SOH 02 FC Data[128] CRC1 CRC2
                                   ACK
   SOH 03 FB Data[100] ^Z[28] CRC1 CRC2
                                   ACK
   EOT
                                   NAK
   EOT
                                   ACK
                                   C
   SOH 00 FF NUL[128] CRC CRC
                                   ACK
