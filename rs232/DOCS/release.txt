*** WSC Version 4.4 Release Notes ***

Added SioSetTimeouts() function (sets TX and RX time-outs).

*** WSC Version 4.3 Release Notes ***

SioShortToByte & SioByteToShort added for converting between 16-bit Unicode & 8-bit ASCII.

*** WSC Version 4.2 Release Notes ***

SioEventChar and SioEventWait functions added.

*** WSC Version 4.1 Release Notes ***

SioEvent uses overlapped I/O in Windows 98 and above (Win95 does not support overlapped I/O).

*** WSC Version 4.0 Release Notes ***

The files WSC32.DLL, MIO32.DLL, XYM32.DLL, WSC16.DLL, MIO16.DLL, and XYM16.DLL 
are all copied to your Windows directory (C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT for Win 2000/NT) 
when SETUP.EXE is run. 

The function SioKeyCode was added to version 4.0 so that the keycode (assigned to 
each registrant) can be passed to WSC32.DLL (or WSC16.DLL for 16-bit applications).

If converting from an earlier version of WSC, do the following:

(1) Add keycode to your "uses" clause in your source program (*.PAS). For example,

     uses
       wsc32, keycode, ...

You can leave 'keycode' out above if you put your numerical keycode value (found in 
keycode.pas) directly into the call to SioKeyCode. 

(2) Add the following code which must be called (once) before any other WSC code:

    {pass the key code}
    if SioKeyCode(WSC_KEY_CODE) < 0 then
      begin 
        ...key-code error...
        exit      
      end;   

    Alternatively, you can paste the value of your actual keycode (the 9 or 10 digit 
    number found in keycode.pas) into SioKeyCode. The keycode for the  evaluation 
    version is always 0.
    
    Refer to VER_PRJ.* and VER_PGM.* for an example.


*** WSC Version 3.2 Release Notes ***

The files WSC32.DLL, MIO32.DLL, XYM32.DLL, WSC16.DLL, MIO16.DLL, and XYM16.DLL are all 
copied to your Windows directory when SETUP.EXE is run. Make a copy of these DLL's in 
case they are over overwritten.

The XMODEM/YMODEM files were renamed from XYDRV* to XYM*. The ASCII Protocol files were 
renamed from ASDRV* to ASD*.

WSC4D is configured for 32-bit Delphi. To compile using 16-bit Delphi 1, run READY16.BAT 
before compiling, which will copy:

  COPY WSC32.PAS WSC.PAS
  COPY XYM32.PAS XYM.PAS
  COPY ASD32.PAS ASD.PAS
  COPY MIO32.PAS MIO.PAS

[END]
