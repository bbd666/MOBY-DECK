=== Description ===

WSC4D is a serial communications library that can be used 
to quickly write serial communication applications in Borland 
(Codegear)Delphi or Delphi for .NET.  WSC4D can be used in the 
development of Win16 or Win32 applications using any version of 
Delphi (including Delphi .NET) running under Windows 
95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP/Vista. The library does not depend on support 
libraries and makes calls to the core Windows API functions only. 

The same WSC16.DLL or WSC32.DLL can also be used with supported 
language such as C/C++ (.NET), PowerBASIC, Basic, Visual Basic, 
VB.Net, Visual FoxPro, Visual dBase, Xbase++, and COBOL as well 
as C++ Builder or any VBA language such as EXCEL and ACCESS.

WSC4D includes 37 functions plus modem control, ANSI emulation, 
ASCII, XMODEM, and YMODEM protocols. A good selection of working
Delphi examples have been provided.

MarshallSoft also has versions of WSC for C/C++ (WSC4C), 
Visual Basic (WSC4VB), Visual FoxPro (WSC4FP), PowerBASIC (WSC4PB),
Visual dBase (WSC4DB), Alaska Xbase++ (WSC4XB), and COBOL (WSC4CB) 
As noted above, all desktop versions of WSC use the same DLL's 
(WSC16.DLL or WSC32.DLL). However, the examples provided for each 
version are written for the specified computer environment. 

=== Installation ===

Run the installation program SETUP.EXE which will
install all WSC4D files, including copying WSC16.DLL
& WSC32.DLL to your Windows directory, C:\WINDOWS for
Win 95/98/Me/XP/Vista or C:\WINNT for Win NT/2000.

Note that DLL registration is not required and that  
no Windows system files are modified. 

WSC4D comes ready to use with all versions of Delphi.
